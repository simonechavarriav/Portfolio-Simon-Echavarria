        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Simon, an economics student at Universidad EIA. I'm always looking for new challenges and I've been passionate about technology since I was a kid, so I decided to start taking software engineering classes, because I enjoy this and I believe it is a very valuable skill.</p>

                        <h3>Random Exoplanet generator</h3>
                        <p>In my first semester of university, I created a python program that generates exoplanets with random attributes, calculates averages, sorts data, and allows for searches. This challenging project involved experimenting with random value generation and data storage in a matrix. It sparked my interest in software engineering and led me to pursue it further.</p>

                        <p>Biblios is a business I started with two of my friends to save parents the time spent in buying school supplies for their kids. The project consists of an e-commerce platform integrated with a payment gateway, automatized invoicing, and different modules for the process of ordering products, packing, and delivering packages. I was not directly involved in writing the code, but I was very involved in the process of software design and architecture.</p>

                            <p>I play tennis three or four times a week, I enjoy the sport a lot, it is a moment of the day where I clear my mind and I focus only on the game, when I return to the rest of my activities I feel recharged and more productive. It is also a very good setting to meet and connect with people.</p>

                            <p>Cooking is a hobby that i've acquired recently. I enjoy cooking because it is a very creative activity, it allows me to experiment with different flavors and ingredients. It is similar to web development in a way, because you have to experiment to see what works and what doesn't, and if you do it correctly, in the end you will have a product or creation that you are proud of.</p>
