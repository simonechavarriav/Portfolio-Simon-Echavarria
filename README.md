# Portfolio
This is my portfolio, it is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for submission of the form and storing the info in a google sheet (Link below)

I also created folders to upload the source code for two of the projects that I included in my portfolio, the links are in the portfolio website on the projects section.

## Instructions to run locally:
Download the folder called portafolio and open it in a code editor, then right click on the file **index.html** and run it
